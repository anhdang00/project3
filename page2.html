      <h2>DRAWING</h2>
      <p class="description">Drawing is something I have always love to do ever since I was a kid. Some people suggest that I should pursue an art-related major, but I think I enjoy drawing more when I do it purely for entertainment.</p>

      <h2>ORIGAMI</h2>
      <p class="description">"Origami" refers to the art of folding paper, orginally from Japan. This is not something I am passionate about, so I only choose to make things that take less than 10 minutes to learn lol. Even though I only do basic stuff, I find it very relaxing and therapeutic.</p>
