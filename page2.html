  <h1>HOBBIES</h1>
  <p>As someone who picks up a new hobby every three to five business days, here are some of my favorite ways to kill time :D</p>  
  <h2>DRAWING</h2>
  <p>Drawing is something I have always love to do ever since I was a kid. Some people suggest that I should pursue an art-related major, but I think I enjoy drawing more when I do it purely for entertainment</p>

  <h2>ORIGAMI</h2>
  <p>"Origami" refers to the art of folding paper, orginally from Japan. This is not something I am passionate about, so I only choose to make things that take less than 10 minutes to learn lol. Even though I only do basic stuff, I find it very relaxing and therapeutic</p>

  <h2>PLAY-DOH</h2>
  <p>Somehow it always takes me hours to make the most simple stuff. Though it is fun, I only make something like once every six months :v</p>
